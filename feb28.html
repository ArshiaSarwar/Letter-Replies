         <p>I remember when u used to show me pics of another woman and simp. Such as that woman in saree. I dont remember her name but it was during roza. U went to a hindu para with her and took pictures of her. It was a photography session. Then a hindu came up to yall and said what are u doing in Ramadan? I remember all of the times u used to show pictures of another woman and I used to say "wow, so pretty" but deep down, I used to zoom in on the pictures and wonder, "what do I lack?" Especially when I saw your first love. I still remember her in a saree, wearing a tip. Looking like an angel god sent down to Earth for you. Maybe that's the reason why I got so obsessed with tip back then. Idk honestly. I hate how insecure I am but I also love how you make me love myself now. Thank you for loving me despite my flaws. </p>
         <p>I love you in every universe.</p>

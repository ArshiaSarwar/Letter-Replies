      <p>Reply for Feb 28th:  </p>
         <p>I remember crying all night to sleep when I had hard days. Then I met you. I thought it would be different. This time, it will change. But seeing you ignoring my feelings broke me. I cried to sleep. Many nights. Again. And that was not even the worst part. The worst part was you still gave me attention. But not when I needed. Not when I was all alone, shivering, hyperventilating. But when you needed me. Sexually. Bodily. As a SA survivor, it broke me. Now that I think about it, if it happened to me now, I would never stay. I would loathe you with every cell of my being. Which I did back then when u left me. When the final string that was holding my love for you snapped. <p>
<p>Yet somehow.... Somehow I could never hate you. I hated you but then I still found myself yearning for your love. I found myself imagining you loving me, kissing my forehead at night when my heart panicked. The love you could never give helped me sleep countless nights. Now I'm here, falling asleep while getting showered with love every single night. Even on the nights we fight. </p>
<p>That final string did snap. But it didn’t fall in void. It was the beginning of me falling for you hard. Falling in your arms. Thank you, my fate, for writing this for me. For writing this life although it’s hard. For writing this man in my life as he is my only ease. And for my man...</p>
<p>I love you in every universe.</p>
<p>P.s.And also it turns out that you are the most handsome man in the whole multiverse :3 (So don't u dare ever think that you are ugly. If you do, you call our Hayyan and Fiona ugly since I see them in my dreams looking like you.)</p>

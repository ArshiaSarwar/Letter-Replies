        <p>Reply for Feb 25th: </p>
        <p>It was the last day of MUN. The place where I met you, where I found my purest love I was dying for. I was
            genuinely nervous and scared that day while raising the DR. I have never done this before and I was scared
            of fucking it up. I have severe level of social anxiety afterall. I was scared that u would lose the award
            because of me, but hey, I doubt even u were as happy as I was when u got the special mention. More like I
            was relieved. I was having a really bad day and planned on leaving soon. But something in me stopped me from
            going and that was the best decision I have ever made. Because of that we got to spend time together. I
            would sell my fortune to get back to that day again.</p>
        <p> Idk if u noticed but during that song "Aj raate kono rupkothha nei" I stood really close to you, maybe bcz
            of crowd or maybe it was just me, but as I felt your presence and smelled your scent, my heart went crazy
            asf. I was confused. Then I was staring at you for a while, staring at that smile and lord! I realised and
            told myself "Arshia, you really fell for this man, didn't you?" I kept convincing myself that this is just
            another attraction. But the more I convinced myself, the more I fell harder. And now here we are, waiting
            for a shaboink as god knows what u are doing {sorry for the wait) and me? writing this while blushing like a
            red tomato with my heart beating like crazy. Just like the day I got close to you. As a woman who HATES
            coding, here I am, spending my whole day coding this website to write reply letters for you, loving you in
            your love language. Ik it is not perfect and I also know that there will be thousands of troubleshooting cz
            I literally learnt coding in a day, thanks to my teacher chatgpt. Please excuse my mistakes. I am still
            learning. </p>
        <p>I love you in every universe, my love. </p>

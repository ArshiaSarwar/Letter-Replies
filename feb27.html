     <p> My love, I don't need "special" days to love you since everyday is special to me when I am with you. I do have days where I struggle to be me which leads to me being off. I am sorry for that but I hope I can be a better girlfriend to you. I know I am ungrateful, my parents told me that I will never be happy because of my standards. I thought they were wrong but seems like yes, they are right indeed. To love with my whole heart, I need to forget the standards set by my brain. Not like I deserve to be treated like my standards anyways. </p>
         <p> But honey remember, even if our brains can be wrong sometimes, our hearts can never be wrong. That is what led to where we are right now. I love you with all of my heart. I don't need much love. Just love me with your heart as love from the core of heart can never not be purest form of love. </p>
         <p> I love you in every universe :3 </p>
